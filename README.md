The website includes a structured menu page, listing all food and beverage items with descriptions and pricing, using Bootstrap cards and grids for an organized layout.
An About Us page narrates the restaurant’s story and values. The Reservation section allows customers to book a table using a simple form. For convenience, there is also an Order Online page integrated with placeholder links to popular delivery services.
The Contact page features the restaurant's location using an embedded Google Map, contact form, and all necessary details.
A Gallery showcases images of dishes and ambience to attract visitors. 
The site also includes sections for Events & Offers, Customer Testimonials, and links to social media handles.
